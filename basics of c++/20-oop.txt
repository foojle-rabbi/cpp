    2. procedure oriented programming (pop)
        * consists of writing a set of instructions for the computer to follow
        * main focus is on funtion and not on flow of data 
        * functions can either use local or global data
        * Data moves openly from funcion to function 

    3. object oriented proramiing (oop)
        * Works on the concept of classes and objects 
        * A class is a template to create objects
        * Treats data as a critical element 
        * Decomposes the problem in objects and builds data and functions around the objects 

    4. Basic concepts in object oriented programming
        * Classes - Basic template for creating objects. 
        * Objects - Basic run time entities
        * Data abstruction and encapsulation - Wrapping data and functions into single unit.
        * Inheritence - Properties of one class can be inherited into others
        * Polymorphism - ability to take more than one forms
        * Dynamic binding - code which will execute is not known until the program runs.
        * message passing - object.message(information) call _get_output_format
    
    5. BENIFITS OF OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
        * better code reusability using objects and inheritance.
        * principle of data hiding helps build secure systems.
        * multiple objects can co-exists without any interference
        * software complexity can be easily managed.
